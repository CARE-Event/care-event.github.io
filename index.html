        <br><br>
        <h2>What Are We?</h2>
        <p>Welcome to "care" â€“ a nonprofit event organized by arvdevable with a mission to spread awareness about Random Acts of Kindness (RAK) and support local charities everywhere.<br>Our goal is to make a positive impact on people's lives and show them that even small acts of kindness can make a big difference.<br><br>

			At "care," we believe that coming together and spreading kindness is the key to creating a better world. <br>That's why we're inviting everyone to join our cause, whether it's by promoting our event, submitting songs, recommending charities, or sharing their ideas and thoughts. <br>By working together, we can make a meaningful difference in the lives of others.<br><br>
			
			Through "care," we hope to inspire and empower people to embrace kindness and compassion as a way of life. <br>We envision a world where people treat each other with respect and empathy, and where kindness is the norm rather than the exception.<br><br>
			
			Our event is scheduled to take place in 2024/2025 on YouTube and Twitch. <br>We welcome all musicians, artists, and creators to submit songs that promote kindness and positivity. <br>We also encourage everyone to recommend charities that they believe in, as we will donate all of the proceeds from the event to support these organizations.<br><br>
			
			Join us in spreading kindness and making the world a better place. <b>Together, we can make a difference!</b></p>
